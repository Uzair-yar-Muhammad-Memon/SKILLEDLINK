Frontend visual polish (2025-11-24)

What changed:
- Upgraded global typography to a modern UI font stack and improved sizing.
- Refined color palette and surface/background variables for a cleaner look.
- Redesigned header: translucent bar, rounded corners, improved nav link styles and active state.
- Polished hero typography and card styling for better hierarchy.
- Redesigned category and worker cards: larger icon/avatar area, improved spacing, subtle shadows and hover lift.
- Updated buttons, inputs and forms with rounded corners, larger tap targets, and improved focus outlines.
- Responsive tweaks for medium/small screens.

Notes:
- No image assets were added. Previously added category/avatar images were removed per request.
- If you want to revert hero background images or further tweak colors, let me know.
